      📘Cracked Token, Cracked Security: Exploiting JWT Misuse in  Juice shop
      🔐 Web Application Penetration Testing – Internship Task

📄 About the Project
This project was conducted as part of my cybersecurity internship under the **Cyber Security (CS) track**. I performed security assessments on a sample web application, targeting common vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and weak authentication controls.

The goal was to simulate real-world ethical hacking practices, document the findings, and recommend mitigation steps for each vulnerability identified.
